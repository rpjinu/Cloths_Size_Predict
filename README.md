# 👕 Clothing Size Prediction API  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project predicts clothing size based on **age, weight, and height** using a machine learning model. The model is trained on a dataset with labeled size categories and deployed as an interactive **Streamlit API** for real-time predictions.  

## 🚀 Features  
✅ Train a machine learning model on size prediction data  
✅ Take user input for **age, weight, and height**  
✅ Predict clothing size (from XXS to XXXL)  
✅ Interactive web app using **Streamlit**  
✅ Scaled dataset for improved model performance  

## 📊 Dataset  
The dataset consists of:  
- **Features**: `age`, `weight`, `height`, `bmi`  
- **Target**: `size` (converted to numerical values)  

Example data after preprocessing:  

| weight | age | height | size | bmi |
|--------|-----|--------|------|-----|
| 62     | 28  | 172.72 | 5    | 2.78 |
| 59     | 36  | 167.64 | 4    | 2.84 |
| 65     | 27  | 175.26 | 4    | 2.69 |
| 79     | 32  | 160.02 | 4    | 2.02 |
| 58     | 35  | 167.64 | 7    | 2.89 |
